In today’s fast-paced digital world, businesses are increasingly looking for ways to harness the power of AI without getting bogged down in complex code. *[PartyRock](http://partyrock.aws)* , is a platform powered by Amazon Bedrock that makes building AI-generated apps enjoyable. In this post, we’ll explore how to Build AI Apps with PartyRock, along with some tips for getting the most out of the experience.

#### **How Does PartyRock Work?**

PartyRock leverages foundation models from Amazon Bedrock to turn your ideas into functional apps. You can create and run apps until you’ve used up your PartyRock credit, giving you ample room to experiment. Here’s what you can do:

* **Get Started**: Create a new PartyRock app, which acts as your starting point.
* **Customize It**: Edit widgets and prompts to tailor the app to your needs. You can change widget prompts so that they connect to each other and get different outcomes.

**Share It**: Once you’re happy with your app, publish it and share it with others.

#### **Creating Your App: Three Simple Options**

PartyRock offers three different ways to start building your app:

1. **Start with a Prompt:** Use the app builder on the PartyRock welcome page. Describe what you want your app to do in a prompt, 1–3 sentences will usually be enough, including inputs and outputs, but you can chose to be as descriptive as you like. PartyRock assembles the app based on your description, and from there, you can tweak and test it to perfection.  
   For tips about how to create a good prompt, see [**Prompt engineering guidelines**](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/prompt-engineering-guidelines.html) in the Amazon Bedrock User Guide.
2. **Remix an Existing App:** Found an app you like? PartyRock lets you remix published apps—whether they’re from other PartyRock users or from PartyRock sample apps. Choose Remix in the top right corner of the app page to create a copy of the app in your account. Use the Backstage find your copy, adjust it to fit your needs, and even add your own unique twists.

3. **Start from Scratch:** Prefer complete control? Start with an empty app and build from the ground up. This option is ideal if you have a specific vision or want to experiment with new layouts.

#### **Managing and Editing Your Apps**

Once your app is up and running, you’ll want to fine-tune and manage it:

* **Access Your Apps:** View, edit, or delete your apps from the [Apps](https://partyrock.aws/apps) page, where you can also monitor their status.
* **Use Editing Mode:** In editing mode, you can add new widgets, make changes to existing widgets, and change the name of the app. Choose the ‘X’ at the upper-right corner of the page to leave editing mode and see what your app looks like when it’s in use. When you make edits to a public app, you must choose “Release Changes” at the top of the page to finalize and share the updated version of your app.
* **Publish and Share:** Ready to go public? Publish your app and grab a shareable URL, making it easy to distribute to friends and colleagues.

Make sure your app follows the [PartyRock community guidelines](https://partyrock.aws/community-guidelines) before you make it public.

#### **Build AI Apps with PartyRock: Our Experience**

We created several test apps to implement in PurpleBox. The most useful application we created is a web-based chatbot application designed to assist penetration tests. The application uses natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning algorithms to understand user queries and provide relevant responses.

We created two different functionalities:

* List the steps to generate a plan for penetration test to a given URL
* Summarize output for a given penetration test

These experiments with PartyRock allow us to create applications that can help automate projects or save our team hours of work.

#### **Lessons Learned in AI App Development**

Developing with PartyRock brings valuable lessons in prompt engineering and AI management:

* **Prompt Quality Matters:** Small tweaks in prompts can dramatically affect results.
* **Context is Key:** Providing clear examples and guidelines helps steer AI outputs.
* **Break Down Tasks:** Dividing complex tasks into smaller, focused prompts improves coherence.
* **Human-AI Feedback Loop:** Iterating based on feedback leads to better results.
* **Be Mindful of Risks:** AI-generated content can sometimes produce biases or inaccuracies.

**Reusable Prompts:** Creating a library of effective prompts can save time in future projects.
