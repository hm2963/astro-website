In The Car, LLC (ITC) has rapidly emerged as a game-changer in the automotive industry by seamlessly integrating auto insurance into every vehicle sale. In an era of fierce market competition due to expanding markets, diverse consumer preferences, and technological advancements, ITC offers a fully embedded, digital-first auto insurance platform. ITC’s innovative platform delivers a frictionless buying experience with a new value proposition. The solution enables original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) and car dealers to generate competitively priced auto insurance quotes within 30 seconds or less at the point of sale.

### Integrating Diverse Data Sources for Seamless Operations

As ITC became part of the dealership sales pipeline across different states, the need arose to integrate several varieties of custom software to trigger the insurance process during the auto sales purchasing cycle. Gathering information from various data sources took time and effort due to the industry’s lack of standardized data formats. This bottleneck could have hindered the efficiency and speed of generating insurance quotes and processing sales.

### PurpleBox Standardizes Data Integration with AWS Services

In The Car turned to PurpleBox (AWS Partner) for their expertise in data digestion and cloud solutions. PurpleBox implemented a Serverless environment to gather and transform data efficiently. The solution included the following AWS services:

*   **AWS Lambda**: Enabled automatic data processing and transformation.
*   **Amazon EventBridge**: Scheduled events for data integration tasks.
*   **Amazon API Gateway**: Managed API requests for data gathering.
*   **Amazon DynamoDB**: Provided scalable and flexible database storage.
*   **Amazon S3**: Offered secure and durable object storage.
*   **Amazon RDS**: Managed relational database services for structured data.
*   **Amazon QuickSight with Q**: Facilitated advanced data analytics and visualization.
*   **Amazon SNS and Amazon Pinpoint**: Enhanced communication and notifications.

This comprehensive approach allowed ITC to standardize a HUB to receive data and transform it into usable information for their team to analyze and model against. Additionally, real-time data gathering enabled ITC to offer discounts based on live information, enhancing customer satisfaction and operational efficiency.

### Significant Improvements in Integration, Cost Optimization, and Sales Automation

The impacts of PurpleBox’s solution for In The Car include:

*   **Successful Integration**: Achieved seamless integration with all Dealer Management Systems (DMS) within the required timeframe, ensuring smooth operations across different states.
*   **Cost Optimization**: Executed cost optimization strategies, eliminating cost leaks in the services used.
*   **Automated Insurance Sales**: Enabled ITC to sell insurance to their customers in an automated manner while performing advanced analytics on both their data and drivers’ data.
