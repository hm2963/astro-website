        <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4 text-white">What is Risk and Compliance?</h2>
        <p class="text-white">Risk management and compliance are two closely related aspects of business that aim to ensure an organization can reliably achieve its goals, manage uncertainty, and do business ethically. Risk management is the process of identifying and addressing risks that may prevent an organization from achieving its goals reliably in the face of uncertainty. Compliance refers to following mandated (laws and regulations) and voluntary (company policies, procedures, and so on) boundaries. The Governance Risk and Compliance (GRC) framework assists a company in aligning its information technology with its business objectives while at the same time managing risk and ensuring regulatory compliance. A well-designed GRC that is compatible with your unique business dynamics has a dominating effect on ensuring and maintaining the durability of your company’s cybersecurity posture.</p>
