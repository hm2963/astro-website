        Ransomware attacks can cause massive disruptions to a business’s productivity, resulting in loss of critical files and demands for payment. To prevent such threats and improve your IT security posture, implement EDR solutions. EDR blocks ransomware attacks before they can hurt your organization, and any encrypted files are rolled back to a secure state. This allows your workforce to continue working uninterrupted with minimal disruption to your business.
      </p>
      <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 dark:text-slate-400 mt-4">
        After cleanup, you’ll receive full post-cleanup information, providing a comprehensive timeline of the attack and helping you identify the entry point and what was affected. With EDR, you can protect your business from ransomware attacks and ensure your critical files are secure.

  <!-- What is Endpoint Security? Section -->
    <section class="py-16 md:py-20 bg-[radial-gradient(circle_at_left_top,rgb(50,17,121)_9%,rgb(22,14,43)_72%)] text-white">

            <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-center mb-8">What is Endpoint Security?</h2>
            <p class="text-lg text-center">
                Endpoint security combines preventative protection with a new breed of continuous detection and response capabilities. Using cloud-based analytics, it eliminates bloated agents from consuming valuable CPU resources so employees can get their work done and businesses remain protected.
            </p>
            <p class="text-lg text-center mt-4">
                Endpoint protection systems are designed to quickly detect, analyze, block, and contain attacks in progress. To do this, they need to collaborate with each other, and with other security technologies, to give administrators visibility into advanced threats to speed detection and remediation response times.

            <h4 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Endpoint Detection and Response (EDR)</h4>
            <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 dark:text-slate-400">Endpoint detection and response (EDR) tools are designed to increase and improve detection, investigation, and response capabilities for endpoint security.</p>
            <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 dark:text-slate-400 mt-4">EDR provides information about what has occurred in the past and what is currently occurring on the endpoints. Threats can be tracked to detect active attackers and IT operations can be leveraged to maintain strong and effective IT security hygiene. When a problem is discovered remotely, i̇t enables a corresponding rapi̇d response to limit the damage.</p>
            <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 dark:text-slate-400 mt-4">EDR prevents breaches from occurring by starting with the strongest protection possible. When hunting down threats and strengthening your IT security operations posture, EDR gives you valuable tools to ask detailed questions and improve your security standing.</p>

            <h4 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4 mt-8">Extended Detection and Response (XDR)</h4>
            <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 dark:text-slate-400">XDR integrates firewall, email, network, email, cloud, mobile and other data sources in addition to endpoints and servers. It provides a comprehensive picture of your company’s cybersecurity posture, with the option to drill down into granular detail if necessary.</p>
            <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 dark:text-slate-400 mt-4">Using XDR, you can swiftly identify, isolate, and eliminate a threat by comparing attack indicators from numerous data sources. XDR allows you to locate unmanaged, guest, and IoT devices throughout your organization’s network. It also enables you to identify any office network problems, as well as the applications that are causing them.</p>

            <h4 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4 mt-8">Managed Threat Response</h4>
            <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 dark:text-slate-400">Managed Threat Response (MTR) facilitates threat hunting through the use of proactive 24/7 tracking by our threat analysts, making the potential impact and context of threats to your business visible to you at any time.</p>
            <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 dark:text-slate-400 mt-4">MTR Initiates actions to remotely disrupt, contain, and neutralize threats on your behalf to stop even the most sophisticated threats. It empowers continuous Improvement by addressing the root cause of recurring incidents to stop them from occurring again, rather than simply one-time fixes.</p>
