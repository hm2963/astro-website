            <p class="text-lg text-center">
                Penetration Testing (Pentesting) is an offensive security approach to test your security controls and identify weaknesses in your application, cloud, network, end-user workstations and mobile devices, and physical security controls through the eyes of a malicious actor. Our experienced security team applies the same tools and techniques used by hackers, by launching pre-authorized, controlled, and coordinated cyber-attacks on your systems. These tools and techniques are designed to gain access to sensitive information, simulate what a real-world attack would target, and demonstrate the efficiency of security controls against potential attacks and data breaches.
