Penetration testing, on the other hand, simulates a real-world attack to exploit those weaknesses—testing how far an attacker could get. Both are important, but serve different purposes in your security strategy.',

        Businesses use the Internet to connect employees, suppliers, and customers globally. However, connecting to the Web poses security risks. Cybercriminals can exploit vulnerabilities to hack networks, steal confidential information, and abuse IT resources. Within an hour of connecting to the Internet, attackers start exploring for vulnerabilities, and if left unsecured, they can launch devastating attacks within 24 hours. Adopting our Vulnerability Management Services can prevent most attacks. Vulnerability Management enables continuous monitoring of network infrastructure and staying ahead of criminals to safeguard corporate resources.
