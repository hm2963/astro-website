        The threat landscape for websites and internet-facing applications is constantly evolving, with cybercriminals becoming more adept than ever at stealing data. Malicious hackers target vulnerable web servers and internet-connected endpoints to achieve their aims. One effective way to safeguard your business from harmful incoming web traffic is by implementing a powerful web application firewall (WAF). The WAF market is rapidly evolving toward an edge security platform approach, which combines a variety of tailored protections for distributed hybrid and multi-cloud environments.

            <p class="text-lg text-center">
                A Web Application Firewall, or WAFs, protects against an ever-growing number of sophisticated web-based incursions and attacks that target web server programs and the sensitive or confidential data they have access to. A WAF filters and monitors HTTP traffic between a web application and the Internet. It typically protects web applications from attacks such as cross-site forgery, cross-site-scripting (XSS), file inclusion, and SQL injection, among others.
            </p>
            <p class="text-lg text-center mt-4">
                Every request to the Web Application Firewall is compared against the rule engine and threat intelligence gathered from millions of websites being protected. Suspicious requests can be stopped, disputed, or logged according to the userâ€™s needs, while genuine requests are sent to the destination, whether on-premises or in the cloud.

  <!-- 4 Reasons Why You Should Use a Web Application Firewall Section -->

    <div class="max-w-4xl mx-auto px-4 sm:px-6">
      <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-center mb-8">4 Reasons Why You Should Use a Web Application Firewall</h2>
      <div class="space-y-8">
        <div>
          <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold">1. Scale with your business</h3>
          <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 dark:text-slate-400 mt-2">WAF solutions take advantage of the power and scalability offered by massive edge networks. Additionally, globally distributed points of presence help to ensure both minimum latency and maximum coverage. WAF quickly isolates endpoints from incoming threats.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold">2. Block attacks outside your perimeter</h3>
          <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 dark:text-slate-400 mt-2">Cloud-based WAF helps to block malicious traffic long before it reaches your network, while also serving as a security perimeter outside of internal or cloud infrastructure. This helps to keep malicious traffic at a safe distance from the application and data servers.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold">3. Protect apps wherever they are hosted</h3>
          <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 dark:text-slate-400 mt-2">Cloud-based WAFs provide a uniform security solution to protect all your apps, regardless of where they reside globally: on-prem data centers, private cloud, and multiple public clouds. WAF protects the network edge from malicious traffic and secures all internet-facing applications and APIs.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold">4. Low total cost of ownership</h3>
          <p class="text-lg text-gray-600 dark:text-slate-400 mt-2">Cloud-based WAFs offer the highest level of web application security possible without requiring a significant upfront investment in resources or recurring costs for maintenance, hardware replacement, or software upgrades.</p>
