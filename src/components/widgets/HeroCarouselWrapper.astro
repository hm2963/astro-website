<!--
  The Swiper initialization script has been removed from this Astro component.
  It is assumed that if client-side interactivity is needed (e.g., for a React-hydrated carousel),
  the React component (HeroCarouselWrapper.tsx) will handle the Swiper initialization.
  If this component is used purely as an Astro component without client-side JS hydration for Swiper,
  the script would need to be reinstated or an alternative Astro-native Swiper integration used.
