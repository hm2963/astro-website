# Astro Website (Experimental Build)

> **Note:** This repository contains an **experimental / in-progress** version of a corporate website I worked on during my internship at PurpleBox.  
> The final production-ready version is stored in the company's **private repository**.  
> This public version showcases my process and skills using Astro, Tailwind CSS, and modern static site development practices.

## 📌 Internship Context
During my internship at PurpleBox, I:
- Migrated an entire corporate website from WordPress to Astro
- Converted 70+ blog posts from HTML to Markdown/MDX format
- Developed reusable Astro components for service descriptions and case studies
- Integrated third-party scripts (HubSpot forms, analytics)
- Created a migration workflow balancing **AI-assisted automation** with **manual refinement**

The **public repo you are viewing now** is based on my early testing and prototyping phase.  
The final product, with complete company-specific content, remains private.
